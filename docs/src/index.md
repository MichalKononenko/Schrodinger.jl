# Schrodinger.jl Documentation


Schrodinger.jl is a package for quantum simulations. Currently it is focused on time dynamics, but will hopefully be expanded to perform all kind of operations.

## Introduction

This website serves as documentation for the Schrodinger.jl package. If you are just getting started with Schrodinger.jl, it is recommended that you first read the manual (or at least the [Getting Started](@ref) page). The different sections of the manual are easily accessible on the left sidebar.

A few tutorials will soon be available.

If you are looking for a particular function, you may browse the API by topic or use the search functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcomed! Please see the repository [on Github](https://github.com/jebej/Schrodinger.jl) and feel free to open issues if you find a bug or if you feel a feature is missing.
